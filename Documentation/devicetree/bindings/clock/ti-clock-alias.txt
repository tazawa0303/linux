* Clock alias provision for TI OMAP2+ boards

This binding allows the board's device tree file to specify a clock name,
device phandle and clock alias so that that clock can be associated
to the device with the alias.

This is required in cases where an external device is clocked by an
OMAP generated clock and needs to be assocated to it.

NOTE: The node's name should be clock_alias

Required properties
- clock-name: The clock identifier string. Should be one of the
  clock ids defined in OMAP common clock data.
- clock-alias: A string specifying the alias that must be created to the clock.
- device: A phandle to the device this clock should be associated to.

e.g. On the OMAP4 Panda board, the USB PHY device is clocked by the
FREF_CLK3 (auxclk3_ck) from the OMAP. The PHY driver expexts the clock to
be named "main_clk". This binding can be provided like so

clock_alias {
	clock-name = "auxclk3_ck";
	clock-alias = "main_clk";
	device = <&hsusb1_phy>;
};
